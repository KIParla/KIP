The KIP corpus is part of the larger [KIParla collection](www.kiparla.it),
which can be freely queried through the [NoSketch Engine interface](https://kiparla.it/search/).

The KIP corpus was compiled within the framework of the LEAdhoC project â€“ Linguistic Expression
of Ad Hoc Categories, funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)
under the SIR 2016 call.

It consists of approximately 70 hours of spoken data collected at the Universities of Bologna and
Turin. The interactions, recorded between 2016 and 2019, involved over 180 speakers, including
university students and professors from various regions of Italy, and took place in five different
types of communicative situations: lessons, exams, office hours, semi-structured interviews,
free conversations (among students).

The transcriptions have been anonymized.

The KIP folder is available for download and contains:

For the entire module:

* A .csv file and a .json file with a list of speaker codes and their associated metadata
  (gender, age group, education level, profession, region of origin).
* A .csv file and a .json file with a list of conversation codes and their associated metadata
  (type of interaction, collection site, year).
* Set of conventions used in the module, .yml

For each conversation:

* Orthographic transcription in .txt format
* Transcription following Jefferson (2004) conventions in .txt format
* Transcription following Jefferson (2004) conventions in .eaf format

Due to GDPR restrictions, the pseudo-anonymized audio files in mp3 format are available under a
restricted-access license.
To gain access to the audio files, it is necessary to contact the corpus coordinators and follow
the procedure they will provide (link to KIP_audio).
